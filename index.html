    <h1>Git Tutorial</h1>
    <p>Why git is important for developers? It makes it easier to colaborate with other and share other projects. It also allows to track your work anytime.. while you work you can sort of take a snapshot of your project so later on in the future you can reutilize or rebuild your work.</p>
    <h2>Useful Git commands</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>git status (tells you if you made any modifications)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>When you start your own repository, you run the following commands:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>git init   (it informs the software that it needs to treat the current directory where you are working on as a repository). YOU ONLY RUN IT ONCE TO INITIALIZE THE DIRECTORY AS A REPOSITORY</li>
        <li>git add -A (it tells git make sure that you keep an eye recognize the changes that I made to all files and directories inside the repository)</li>
        <li>git commit -m "YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE"    (this is what you do to create a remote backup of your code since your code before this commands was only living on your local machine)</li>
        <li>git remote add origin URL_TO_REMOTE_REPO</li>
        <li>git push origin main<strong> or</strong> git push origin master</li>


    </ul>
